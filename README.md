# Relay-Lamp-ESP32
A simple ESP32 project to control an AC appliance using a relay module, along with an LED indicator. This project demonstrates how to safely control high-voltage devices (like a lamp) with a low-voltage microcontroller. The LED is used as a visual indicator of the relay's state. The code is written in C++ and runs on the Arduino IDE.
